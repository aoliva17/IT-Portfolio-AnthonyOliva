## Networking Project: Network Access Control Using ACLs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on securing enterprise networks through the implementation of Access Control Lists (ACLs). The lab demonstrates how traffic can be selectively permitted or denied between subnets to enforce organizational security policies.

## Project Goal

Control and restrict network traffic between segments using ACLs while maintaining required connectivity for authorized services.

## Network Security Design

## Subnetting & Address Planning

The network was subnetted to support multiple segments, providing a structured foundation for applying traffic control policies.

## ACL Implementation

Standard and extended ACLs were configured to filter traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, enforcing segmentation and limiting unauthorized access between networks.

## Traffic Enforcement & Validation

ACL behavior was validated by testing permitted and denied traffic flows to confirm that security policies were functioning as intended.
